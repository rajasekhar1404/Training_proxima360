1. List down all the Oracle database objects.
Ans.
Here are the different types of objects in Oracle.
1. Table:
    Oracle stores information in the form of tables, For example you can store students information about name class and marks,
    A table is known as an entity and the columns as it attributes.

2. views:
    VIEWs are stored queries, views do not actually contain data, but instead derive their data from the tables upon which they are based.
    Similar to tables, views can be queried, updated, inserted into and deleted from, with some restrictions.
    All operations performed on a view actually affect the base tables of the view.
    Views can provide an additional level of security by restricting access to a predetermined set of rows and columns of a table.
    They can also hide data complexity and store complex queries.

3. Indexes:
    Indexes are optional schema objects that are associated with tables.
    You can create indexes on tables to improve query performance. Just as the index in a guide helps you to quickly locate specific information.
    an oracle database index provide quick access to table data.

4. Synonyms:
    A synonym is a name assigned to a table or view that may be used refer to it thereafter.
    If you have an access to another users table, you may create a synonym for it and refer to it by the synonym alone,
    Without entering the users name as a qualifier.

5. Sequences:
    A sequence is a unique number generator which can be assigned to the primary key of the tables.
    It will generate a number based no the condition given while creating the Sequence.

============================================================
2. Give the syntax for Creating, Altering, and deleting a table with examples.
Ans.
--Creating a table
    --Syntax
    CREATE TABLE table_name (Column_names Datatypes Constraints);
    --Example
    CREATE TABLE Emp_details(Emp_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, Emp_name VARCHAR2(30), Dept_Name VARCHAR2(30), Salary NUMBER);
    
    --Syntax for creating a table from an existing table
    CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS SELECT * FROM old_table_name;
    
    --Example
    CREATE TABLE Emp_details_1 AS SELECT * FROM Emp_details;

--Altering a table
    --Syntax
    ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name Datatype; --For adding a column
    ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name; --For deleting a column
    ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_column_name; --For renaming a column name
    ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name type_of_constraint(column_name); --For adding a constraint
    ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name datatype; --For modifying datatype of a column
    
    --Example
    ALTER TABLE Emp_details_1 ADD Joining_date DATE;
    ALTER TABLE Emp_details_1 DROP COLUMN Joining_date;
    ALTER TABLE Emp_details_1 RENAME COLUMN Joining_date TO Emp_Joining_Date;
    ALTER TABLE Emp_details_1 ADD CONSTRAINT emp_id_check PRIMARY KEY(Emp_ID);
    ALTER TABLE Emp_details_1 MODIFY Emp_Joining_Date VARCHAR2(30);
    
--Deleting a table
    --Syntax
    DROP TABLE table_name;
    
    --Example
    DROP TABLE Emp_details;

============================================================
3. Give the syntax to Alter a table using a subquery.
Ans.

It is not possible to use subqueries in alter table statement,
We can use subqueries only in 
    1. WHERE clause
    2. FROM Clause
    3. SELECT Clause

============================================================
4. Why are views being used? Create a view to obtain data from the buyer and division table.
Ans.
Views are used for security purposes because they provide encapsulation of the name of the table.
Data is in the virtual table. Views display only selected data. We can also use sql joins in the select statement in deriving the data for the view.

--Creating a simple view with single table.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW div_names AS SELECT DIV_NAME FROM DIVISION;
--Retriving the data using view.
SELECT * FROM div_names;

--Creating a view with a subquery
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW local_buyers AS SELECT b.Buyer, b.Buyer_Name, b.Buyer_Phone, b.Buyer_Fax FROM Division d, Buyer b WHERE b.buyer = d.buyer;
--Retriving the data using view
SELECT Buyer_name, Buyer_phone FROM local_buyers WHERE Buyer BETWEEN 1000 AND 1005;

============================================================
5. Create a sequence that starts with 1 and increments by 10.
Ans.
/*Here is the sequence creation which will start with 1 and increment by 10, 
it can increase upto 500, once it reaches to 500 it will startover because we Enabled the CYCLE,
And upto 50 sequences can be preallocated in the database memory.*/

CREATE SEQUENCE emp_id_auto
INCREMENT BY 10
START WITH 1
MAXVALUE 500
CYCLE
CACHE 50;

============================================================
6. Write the query to insert data into a column in a table using a sequence.
Ans.
--Inserting data into table with a sequence.
INSERT INTO Emp_details_1 VALUES('Rajasekhar', 'Admin', 24000, '01-06-2022', emp_id_auto.NEXTVAL);

============================================================
7. Modify the above-created sequence by incrementing the values by 100.
Ans.
--Modifying the sequence to increment by 100.
ALTER SEQUENCE emp_id_auto INCREMENT BY 100 NOCACHE;

============================================================
8. Why do we need indexes?
Ans.
We need indexes to quickly access rows from a table, 
it will provide faster access to data for operations that return a portion of a tables rows.
we can have unlimited number of indexes on a table.

============================================================
9. List down all the key constraints that we employ in Oracle.
Ans.
1. PRIMARY KEY
    The Primary Key can be used to make sure the column can only have unique and not null values.

2. FOREIGN KEY
    The Foreign Key provides the link between the two tables, it is a field in one table,
    that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table, the table with foreign key called the child table,
    and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parant table.

3. NOT NULL
    The NOT NULL constraint is used to ensure that a given column of a table is never assigned the null value.
    Once a NOT NULL constraint has been defined for a particular column, 
    any insert or update operations that attempts to place null values in that column will fail.

4. UNIQUE KEY
    Unique key is used to make sure only the unique values will be inserted in a column,
    we can have more than one unique key per table.

5. CHECK
    The check constraint enables a condition to check the value being entered into a record,
    If the condition evaluates to false, the record violates the constraint and isn't entered the table.

============================================================
10. Give the syntax to create a primary key in a table with an example DDL.
Ans.
--Here is an example to add primary key for a column.
CREATE TABLE Emp_details(Emp_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, Emp_name VARCHAR2(30), Dept_Name VARCHAR2(30), Salary NUMBER);

--Adding primary key by altering table.
ALTER TABLE Emp_details ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_pk PRIMARY KEY(Emp_ID);

============================================================
11. Use the above created primary key to create a foreign key in another table.
Ans.
--Here is the syntax for creating a table and adding foreign key to it using departments as parent table.

    CREATE TABLE Emp_details
    (Emp_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    Emp_Name VARCHAR2(30), 
    Dept_name VARCHAR2(30),
    CONSTRAINT constraint_fk FOREIGN KEY(Dept_name) REFERENCES departments(DEPT_NAME));

============================================================
12. Delete the above-created primary key with all its dependencies from another table.
Ans.
We can delete the foreign key's while dropping the primary key by using CASCADE key word.
Example:
--It will removes the PRIMARY KEY from departments table along with all the foreign's depended on it.
ALTER TABLE departments DROP PRIMARY KEY CASCADE;

============================================================
13. What is the optional keyword that we use when deleting all the dependencies of a Primary key constraints
Ans.
It is CASCADE, by using this keyword we can delete all the reference foreign key's linked with the primary key,
also if we add ON DELETE CASCADE with the FOREIGN KEY while creating a table,
then if we delete a primary key value, it will automatically deletes all the foreign values related to that primary key value.

Ex: I have two tables Departments with a primary key on dept_name, emp_details with a foreign key on dept_name.

--Here is the structure of my Emp_details table.
    CREATE TABLE Emp_details (Emp_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, Emp_Name VARCHAR2(30), Dept_name VARCHAR2(30),
    CONSTRAINT constraint_fk FOREIGN KEY(Dept_name) REFERENCES departments(DEPT_NAME) ON DELETE CASCADE);

If i delete a department value from departments table, the employees belongs to that department are also deleted from Emp_details table.
