1. Read through Different Data Types available in SQL
Ans.
We have following datatypes in Oracle SQL:
	I. Character datatypes
		1. CHAR: It is used to Store Character data with predefined length, Default size is 1 byte per row, it can store up to 2000 bytes.
		2. NCHAR: It is used to Store National Character data like UNICODE, it can store up to 2000 bytes.
		3. VARCHAR2(size): It is used to store variable string data within the predefined length. It can store up to 4000bytes.
		4. NVARCHAR2(size): It is used to store UNICODE string data within the predefined length. It can store upto 4000bytes.
	II. NUMBER datatypes
		1. NUMBER(p,s): It is used to store the numbers, It contains precision p and scale s, The precision p can range from 1 to 38 and scale s can range from -84 to 127.
		2. FLOAT(p): It is a subtype of NUMBER data type, The precision p can range from 1 to 126.
		3. BINARY_FLOAT: It is used for binary precision(32-bit). It requires 5 bytes, including length byte.
		4. BINARY_DOUBLE: It is used for double binary precision (64-bit). It requires 9 bytes, including length byte.
	III. DATE and TIME datatypes
		1. DATE: It is used to store a valid date format with a fixed length, It ranges from 1-JAN-4712 BC to 31-DEC-9999 AD.
		2. TIMESTAMP: It is used to store the valid date YYYY-MM-DD with hh:mm:ss format.
	IV. BINARY datatype
		1. BLOB: It is used to specify unstructured binary data. It ranges upto 4GB.
		2. BFILE: It is used to store binary data in an external file. it ranges upto 4GB.
		3. RAW(size): It is used to specify variable length raw binary data. It ranges upto 2000 bytes per row.
		4. LONG RAW: It is used to speciry variable length raw binary data, It ranges upto 4GB per row.

2. What is RDBMS?
Ans.
RDBMS(Relational Database Management System) is a Collection of programs that let others to CREATE, UPDATE or INTERACT with a Relational Database. 
It stores the data in the form of tables.

============================================================

3. What are different DDL &. DMLs? Explain with examples.
Ans.
DDL means Data Definition Language. It is used to CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, DROP the structure of database objects in SQL.
1. CREATE - It is used to create a new table in the database.
CREATE TABLE Employees(Name VARCHAR2(30), Email VARCHAR2(50), DOB DATE);

2. ALTER - It is used to alter the structure of the database. This change could be either to modify the characteristics of an existing attribute or probably to add a new attribute.
ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Department VARCHAR2(10);
ALTER TABLE Employees MODIFY Department NOT NULL;

3. TRUNCATE - It is used to delete all the rows from the table.
TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;

4.  DROP - It is used to delete both the structure and the records stored in the table.
DROP TABLE Employees;

DML means Data Manipulation Language. It is used to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE in database.
1. SELECT - It is used to show the records of the specified table and also to show the particular columns by using the WHERE clause.
SELECT * FROM Employees;
SELECT Name, Email FROM Employees;
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE DOB='01-JAN-1999';

2. INSERT - It is used to INSERT data into the row of a table.
INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Email, DOB) VALUES('Rajasekhar', 'mrrajasekhar09@gmail.com', '18-MAY-1999');
INSERT INTO VALUES('James', 'example@gmail.com', '01-JAN-1998');

3. UPDATE - The command is used to update or modify the value of a column in the table.
UPDATE Employees SET Name='Rajasekhar Karampudi' WHERE Email='mrrajasekhar09@gmail.com';

4. DELETE - It is used to remove one or more rows from a table.
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Name='Rajasekhar Karampudi';

============================================================

4. Differentiate between Truncate and Delete statement.
Ans.
TRUNCATE removes all the rows from a table and the changes will be commited automatically, we can not ROLLBACK once we execute TRUNCATE.
whereas DELETE removes one or multiple rows based on the condition, it is a DML command, we have to COMMIT it manully and it can be rolled back.

5. Create a Student Table containing student information and insert data.
Ans. 
-- Student Table Creation
CREATE TABLE Student(First_Name VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL, Last_Name VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL, Department VARCHAR2(20), Roll_Number NUMBER PRIMARY KEY);

-- Data insertion into Student Table
INSERT INTO Student VALUES('Rajasekhar', 'Karampudi', 'Civil', 1);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES('Shankar', 'Vemula', 'EEE', 2);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES('Yashodha', 'Charla', 'Civil', 3);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES('Vinay', 'Alakuntla', 'Mech', 4);
INSERT INTO Student VALUES('Mohan', 'Jarpala', 'Civil', 5);

============================================================

6. Create a Marks Table containing marks of each student subject wise and insert data. (Each subject exam is held for a total of 200 marks)
Ans.
-- Marks Table Creation
CREATE TABLE Marks(Full_Name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL, Subject VARCHAR2(20), Marks NUMBER(3));

/*Inserting data into Marks Table*/
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Yashodha Charla', 'Maths', 189);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Rajasekhar Karampudi', 'Physics', 134);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Shankar Vemula', 'Social', 190);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Vinay Alakuntla', 'Maths', 137);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Mohan Jarpala', 'Biology' 144);

============================================================

7. Create some duplicate marks and write a query to eliminate duplicate marks.
Ans.
/*Duplicate data insertion into Marks Table*/
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Yashodha Charla', 'Maths', 189);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Rajasekhar Karampudi', 'Physics', 134);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Shankar Vemula', 'Social', 190);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Yashodha Charla', 'Maths', 189);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Vinay Alakuntla', 'Maths', 137);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Mohan Jarpala', 'Biology' 144);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Shankar Vemula', 'Social', 190);
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Rajasekhar Karampudi', 'Physics', 134);

-- QUERY for selecting only Distinct values
SELECT DISTINCT Full_Name, Subject, Marks FROM Marks;

============================================================

8. Write a query to get the student, subject, marks, percentage of marks obtained in that subject for each student. And display calculated percentage column name as pct in the query.
Ans.
-- QUERY for selecting Full_Name, Subject, Marks, percentage from Marks Table
SELECT Full_Name, Subject, Marks, (Marks/200)*100 AS pct FROM Marks;

============================================================

9. Insert NULL data for a particular subject in the marks table when the student was absent for that exam.
Ans.
-- QUERY for inserting NULL data
INSERT INTO Marks VALUES('Yogesh pasunuti', 'Maths', null);

============================================================

10. Give some examples for concatenation and format the output using aliases.

-- concatenation Expmples:
SELECT Full_Name||'/'||Marks||'/'||Subject AS Results FROM Marks;
SELECT 'Hello! '|| Full_Name || ', You have scored '|| Marks || ' marks in ' || Subject || ' Subject.' AS Results FROM Marks;

============================================================

11. Explain about projection and selection and how they differ from each other. 
Ans.
Projection: This is a vertical subset of table column, including all rows. It may include one column, two columns or all the table columns.
Selection: This is a horizontal subset of table columns, It may include one row, two rows or all table rows, which the QUERY returns based on the WHERE condition.
Difference: The difference between selection and projection is Selection means which rows are to be returned and Projection means choosing which columns the query shall return.
