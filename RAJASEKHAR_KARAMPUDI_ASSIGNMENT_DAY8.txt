============================================================
1. Practice Anonymous block statements.
Ans.
Here are some of the different Anonymous PL/SQL blocks.
Example_1:
    DECLARE
    BEGIN
    NULL;
    END;
    /
/*
Declared a simple block with DECLARE, BEGIN and END sections which don't perform any action.
*/

Example_2:
    BEGIN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Proxima360');
    END;
    /
/*
The above code consist of only BEGIN block with a print statement printing message of Proxima360.
*/

Example_3:
    DECLARE
        First_Name VARCHAR2(30) := 'Rajasekhar';
    BEGIN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(First_Name);
    END;
    /
/*
The above code consist of DECLARE and BEGIN blocks,
In the DECLARE block we are declaring a variable of First_Name with a datatype of VARCHAR2, and initialized it with a value.
In the BEGIN block, printing the value of variable First_Name.
*/

Example_4:
    DECLARE
        First_Name VARCHAR2(30);
    BEGIN
        First_Name := 'Rajasekhar';
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(First_Name);
    END;
    /
/*
In the above code, declaring a variable without initializing it and in the BEGIN block initializing it with a value, then printing it.
*/

Example_5:
    DECLARE
        First_Name Employee.Emp_Name%TYPE;
    BEGIN
        SELECT Emp_Name INTO First_Name FROM Employee WHERE Emp_ID = 101;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(First_Name);
    END;
    /
/*
In the above code, i'm declaring a variable First_Name and giving the datatype from Employee table Emp_Name column using %TYPE operater.
Then writing a select query to get the Emp_name and initializing that value to First_Name variable.
And printing the First_Name value.
*/

============================================================
2. Practice Anonymous block statements with variables being declared and initialized. 
Ans.
Here are the Examples for Anonymous blocks which are declared and initialized.
Example_1:
    DECLARE
        First_Name VARCHAR2(30) := 'Rajasekhar';
        Last_Name VARCHAR2(30) := 'Karampudi';
    BEGIN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(First_Name || ' ' || Last_Name);
    END;
    /
/*
In the above code, i have declared two variables First_Name and Last_Name with values,
In the Begin block, i performed the concatination and printed the value.
*/

Example_2:
    DECLARE
        L_Emp_ID Employee.Emp_Name%TYPE := 112;
        L_Emp_Name Employee.Emp_Name%TYPE := 'Raja sekhar';
        L_Dept_Name Employee.Dept_Name%TYPE := 'IT';
        L_Salary Employee.Salary%TYPE := 9900;
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO Employee VALUES(L_Emp_ID, L_Emp_Name, L_Dept_Name, L_Salary);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee data added to table');
    END;
    /
/*
In the above code, i am declaring 4 variables with datatypes from Employees table and assigning values to it.
Then in the BEGIN section i was inserting all the values into the employees table using the variables,
Then printing a message as Employee data added.
*/

Example_3:
    DECLARE
        L_Emp_ID CONSTANT NUMBER := 102;
        L_Emp_Name Employee.Emp_Name%TYPE;
        L_Dept_Name Employee.Dept_Name%TYPE;
        L_Salary Employee.Salary%TYPE;
    BEGIN
        SELECT Emp_Name, Dept_Name, Salary INTO L_Emp_Name, L_Dept_Name, L_Salary FROM Employee WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(
        'Here is the Employee details of ' 
        || L_Emp_Name || ', He is working in ' 
        || L_Dept_Name || ' Department with the salary of ' 
        || L_Salary || ' Rupees per month');
    END;
    /
/*
In the above code, i am declaring a constant variable L_Emp_ID with a value, and some more variables with datatype form employee table.
In the begin block i was selecting Emp_name, dept_name, salary of the emp_id which is declared in the declare section.
And storing them in the Local variables,
Then printing a message using all the variables.
*/

============================================================
3. Practice Anonymous block statements with variables being declared using %type attribute. 
Ans.
Examples for pl/sql statements with %type variables.
Example_1:
    DECLARE
        L_Merch Merch.Merch%TYPE;
        L_Division Division.Division%TYPE;
        L_Div_Name Division.Div_Name%TYPE;
        L_Buyer Division.Buyer%TYPE;
        L_D_Merch Division.Merch%TYPE;
        L_Total_Market_amt Division.Total_market_amt%TYPE;
    BEGIN
        SELECT MERCH INTO L_Merch FROM MERCH WHERE MERCH_NAME = 'Kelly Johnson';
        SELECT Division, Div_Name, Buyer, Merch, Total_Market_amt INTO L_Division, L_Div_Name, L_Buyer, L_D_Merch, L_Total_Market_amt FROM Division WHERE MERCH = L_Merch;
    END;
    /
/*
Here i'm declaring variables from taking datatypes of merch and division tables,
assigning L_Merch with the value from merch table where merch_name is kelly johnson,
using that L_Merch value i was getting information from division table.
*/

Example_2:
    DECLARE
        L_Dept_ID Departments.Dept_ID%TYPE;
        L_Dept_Name Employee.Dept_Name%TYPE;
    BEGIN
        L_Dept_ID := 112;
        SELECT Dept_Name INTO L_Dept_Name FROM Departments WHERE Dept_ID = L_Dept_ID;
        UPDATE Employee SET Salary = Salary+(10*salary/100) WHERE Dept_Name = L_Dept_Name;
    END;
    /
/*
In the above code, i am declaring two variables by taking their datatypes form tables using %type.
In the begin block i have assigned a value for L_Dept_ID, and getting the department name from departments table of that id.
then updating all the employees salary of that department to 10%.
*/

============================================================
4. Practice nested Anonymous block statements.
Ans.
Here are the Example for Nested blocks.
Example:
    DECLARE
        L_Emp_Name Employee.Emp_Name%TYPE;
        L_Salary Employee.Salary%TYPE;
        L_Emp_ID Employee.Emp_ID%TYPE;
    BEGIN
        BEGIN
            L_Emp_ID := 101;
            SELECT SALARY INTO L_Salary FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
            L_Salary := L_Salary + (10*L_Salary/100);
            UPDATE Employee SET Salary = L_Salary WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
            SELECT Emp_Name, Salary INTO L_Emp_Name, L_Salary FROM Employee WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello ' || L_Emp_Name || ' Your salary updated to ' || L_Salary || ' rupees.');
        END;
        
        BEGIN
            L_Emp_ID := 102;
            SELECT SALARY INTO L_Salary FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
            L_Salary := L_Salary + (5*L_Salary/100);
            UPDATE Employee SET Salary = L_Salary WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
            SELECT Emp_Name, Salary INTO L_Emp_Name, L_Salary FROM Employee WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello ' || L_Emp_Name || ' Your salary updated to ' || L_Salary || ' rupees.');
        END;
        
        BEGIN
            L_Emp_ID := 103;
            SELECT SALARY INTO L_Salary FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
            L_Salary := L_Salary + (15*L_Salary/100);
            UPDATE Employee SET Salary = L_Salary WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
            SELECT Emp_Name, Salary INTO L_Emp_Name, L_Salary FROM Employee WHERE Emp_ID = L_Emp_ID;
            DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello ' || L_Emp_Name || ' Your salary updated to ' || L_Salary || ' rupees.');
        END;
    END;
    /
/*
In the above code, i have declared 3 variables L_Emp_Name, L_Emp_ID, L_Salary,
In the begin block, i have created nested blocks for each employee and gave the different amount of hikes for each.
And printing message for each employee as their salary updated.
*/

============================================================
5. Give the example for scope of variable being used.
Ans.
Example for scope in pl/sql.
DECLARE
    L_Student_Name Students.Student_Name%TYPE;
BEGIN
    DECLARE
        Marks NUMBER;
    BEGIN
        SELECT MAX(maths) INTO Marks FROM students;
        SELECT student_name INTO L_Student_Name FROM students WHERE maths = Marks;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(L_Student_Name ||', Congrants you got the highest score of ' || Marks||' in Maths.');
    END;
    
    DECLARE
        Marks NUMBER;
    BEGIN
        SELECT MAX(social) INTO Marks FROM students;
        SELECT student_name INTO L_Student_Name FROM students WHERE social = Marks;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(L_Student_Name ||', Congrants you got the highest score of ' || Marks||' in social.');
    END;
    --Below line will won't execute coz it don't know what is Marks, we are accessing it out of the scope.
    --DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(Marks || ' are the hightest marks in Social.');
END;
/
/*
The above code is having a variable L_Student_Name, in the begin blocks there are two nested blocks which are having marks variables.
each block can able to access the outer L_Student_Name variable, but at the end of outer block i was trying to access the marks which is declared inside, so it can't access it.
*/
============================================================
6. Practice Anonymous block statements using different operators.
Ans.
Examples of pl/sql statements with different operators.
Example_1:
--Using addition, subtraction, concatenation operaters.
DECLARE
    L_Student_Name Students.Student_Name%TYPE;
    L_Marks NUMBER;
    L_Maths NUMBER;
    L_Physics NUMBER;
    L_Social NUMBER;
BEGIN
    L_Student_Name := 'Shankar';
    SELECT Maths, Physics, Social INTO L_Maths, L_Physics, L_Social FROM Students WHERE Student_Name = L_Student_Name;
    L_Marks := 300 - (L_Maths+L_Physics+L_Social);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(L_Student_Name ||', You missed ' || L_Marks || ' Marks.');
END;
/

Example_2:
--Using multiplication, divide operaters.
DECLARE
    L_Student_Name Students.Student_Name%TYPE;
    L_Marks NUMBER;
    L_Maths NUMBER;
    L_Physics NUMBER;
    L_Social NUMBER;
BEGIN
    L_Student_Name := 'Rajasekhar';
    SELECT Maths, Physics, Social INTO L_Maths, L_Physics, L_Social FROM Students WHERE Student_Name = L_Student_Name;
    L_Marks := ((L_Maths+L_Physics+L_Social)/300)*100;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(L_Student_Name ||', You scored ' || L_Marks || '% in Final exams.');
END;
/
